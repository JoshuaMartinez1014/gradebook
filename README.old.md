# Gradebook

## Description
This application exhibits a student's grades in a simple and organized manner. Grades can be viewed by a user that is a teacher or a student. New users must sign up to access most of the application, and returning users can log in. The server-side code is heavily dependent on MongoDB and Mongoose. There are four models used in the creation of this application: User, Grade, Class, and Assignment.

The calendar feature shows each month's assignments. The calendar utilizes a JavaScript library called FullCalendar, which works well with React.

## Tests
Testing this program can be done in a local environment by entering the `npm run develop` command in a terminal. Make sure the terminal is open at the root level.
